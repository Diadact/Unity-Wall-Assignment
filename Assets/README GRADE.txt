I think this project should be marked at a 75% Althought the game is not a full shooter it has all of the aspects of one.
Enemy with AI that chase and hurt the player. An Enemy spawner. Particle effects on important events and objects such as 
Enemy death, bullet, and portal. The player doesnt actually "die" but can run out of HP at which point the debug log alerts
you to this. I have a working ammo system that can run out of ammo, takes from an ammo cache, and has a maximum clip and
capacity. A 75% is the mark I have given this project.
